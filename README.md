# Dial Graph
## Created by Todd Eischeid

Dial graphs are a way to very quickly scan a set of metrics and determine if any values are out of range.

The concept is based in past avaiation research on check reading, which shows that pilots could discern out
of range values of an array of 16 dials with exposure times of only a fraction of a second.

I implemented this in d3js, and the example files here intentionally do not use any other frameworks, in order
to keep it simple and understandable.
